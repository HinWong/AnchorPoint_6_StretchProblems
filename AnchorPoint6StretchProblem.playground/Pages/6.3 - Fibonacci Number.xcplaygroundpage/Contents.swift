 ## Fibbonacci Number
 
 ### Instructions:
 1. Create a function that finds the closest fibonacci number that is less than or equal to the number that is passed into a function.
 2. Don't hesitate to Google what a Fibonacci number is.
 3. Test it by passing in the number 2000. We will compare results.
